                    I am currently a <B>technology summer analyst at BNY Mellon</B>,working alongside 
                    a great group of people in the master data management team. I am also a 
                    <B> rising junior at Columbia University</B> where I have worked as a summer 
                    researcher at the DVMM lab and as a product engineer at The Daily Spectator. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    As an engineer, <B>I enjoy tackling all problems</B>, big or small, through the 
                    use of software. I love the process of thinking up answers and building 
                    them out, all while picking up new skills and technologies. Through my 
                    knowledge and experiences, I hope to continuosly create impactful and 
                    innovative technical solutions to peopleâ€™s problems. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Away from the keyboard, I love to spend my free time cooking up new 
                    recipes, exploring the city, and playing video games.
